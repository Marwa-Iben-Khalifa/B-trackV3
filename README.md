# B-trackV3

Full-Stack React Project

For the final project at the Ironhack bootcamp, we created a single-page web application named "B-Track" using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React & Node.js). Our B-Track website is a concrete, easy-to-use application that allows your company to save wasting time in reporting bugs or any issues in a simple and relevant way.

This application (back & front) is hosted on Heroku.

You can test the website, either by creating a new account as a company or by requesting to register as an employee using the form provided and choosing your company.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory client, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:port](`http://localhost:${x.connections[0].name}`) to view it in postman. //Hint: x.connections[0].name in .env file
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.


In the project directory server, you can run:

### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:port](`http://localhost:${x.connections[0].name}`) to view it in postman. //Hint: x.connections[0].name in .env file


The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.


### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you canâ€™t go back!**

If you arenâ€™t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point youâ€™re on your own.

You donâ€™t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldnâ€™t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldnâ€™t be useful if you couldnâ€™t customize it when you are ready for it.
